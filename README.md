Hi, I’m nobraincells490! 🍄
 I like horror games, indie games, and anime games, and
 I’m learning how to code and how to develop games.
 I’m looking to collaborate with someone on a fan-made FNaF game.
 How to reach me: Email me evietrapp7@gmail.com
 Also, if you would like to add me on Minecraft, Roblox, or Genshin Impact, email me first! I will give you my username, gamertag, or UID.
 I do not use Discord, sorry!
